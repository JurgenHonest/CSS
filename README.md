# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It enables web developers to separate content (HTML) from design (CSS), allowing for more flexible and maintainable web pages. CSS defines how elements should be displayed on different devices by specifying styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness.
